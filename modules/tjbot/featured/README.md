# Featured Recipes
Featured recipes are some exciting recipes created by TJBot enthusiasts.


- **[TJWave](https://github.com/victordibia/tjwave)** : Fun controller recipe for TJBot's servo arm.
- **[Build a TJBot That Cares](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-developer-cloud/build-a-chatbot-that-cares-part-1-d1c273e17a63#.vtxwvsydl)** : This recipe puts a voice interface onto TJBot, then gives it the ability to converse and understand your emotional tones.
- **[SwiftyTJ](https://github.com/jweisz/swifty-tj)** : This recipe enables TJBotâ€™s LED to be controlled from a Swift program.
- **[TJ Weather](https://github.com/suprbh/tjweather)** : TJBOt as a personal weather station
- **[Project Intu](https://github.com/watson-intu/self-sdk#raspberry-pi)** : Project Intu is an experimental service that allows developers to quickly and seamlessly integrate various cognitive services, such as Conversation and Speech-to-Text, with the capabilities of various devices, spaces and physical objects. While not being a recipe, Intu is a middleware that can be installed on TJBot and used to architect more complex interactions for your robot.

# Contributing Your Own Recipes

TJBot is open source and we'd love to see what you can make with him. If you would like your recipe to be featured here, send us an email at tjbot@us.ibm.com.
Here are some ideas to get you started.

    - Visual recognition. TJBot has a placeholder behind his left eye to insert a Raspberry Pi camera. Try connecting the camera to the Watson Visual Recognition API so TJ can say hello when he sees you.

    - IoT. The Watson IoT service lets you control smart home devices (e.g. Philips Hue, LIFX lights, etc. ). Connect TJBot to IoT and have him control your home.

    - Connected robots. You can program multiple TJBots to send messages to each other using the Watson IoT platform.

Submit a pull request for your receipe instructions and code and send a link to a demo video to tjbot@us.ibm.com (Vimeo & YouTube preferred). We will review it and if we decide to include it in our repository, you'll be listed as the developer. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

We cannot wait to see what you build with TJBot!
